# genoma-path
This is a project that aims to reassemble genomes.
In the main program, a text file with the k-mers is received and the reassembled sequence is written to the output.txt file in a single line.
The files 'c120.txt' and 'c30000.txt' contain k-mers in alphabetical order that can serve as input to the program.
In the file 'compositions.txt', the result of the composition function of the main file is written. This function receives a sequence and a value k and returns k-mers of that sequence in alphabetical order.
